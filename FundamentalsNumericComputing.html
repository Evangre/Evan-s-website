    <h2>Week 1</h2>
    <h4><u>Materials Learned</u></h4>
    <ul>
      <li>Payroll and Taxes</li>
      <li>Average and Weighted Mean</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      Payroll and taxes involve a number of calculations and operations that
      require numeric computing. For example, when calculating an employee's
      gross pay, you might need to multiply the employee's hourly wage by the
      number of hours worked, and then add any overtime pay or bonuses. To
      perform these calculations, you can use a programming language or
      spreadsheet software that supports numeric computing. This will allow you
      to write formulas or functions that can perform the calculations
      automatically, based on input data such as the employee's wage and hours
      worked. The average and weighted mean are two types of mathematical
      measures of central tendency that are used to summarize and describe a set
      of numeric data. Both measures provide a way to calculate a single value
      that represents the "typical" or "average" value in a data set, but they
      differ in how they take into account the different values and weights of
      the data points.

    <h2>Week 2</h2>
    <h4><u>Materials Learned</u></h4>
    <ul>
      <li>Real Income</li>
      <li>CPI</li>
      <li>Personal Income Tax</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      Real income is a measure of the purchasing power of a person's income,
      adjusted for changes in the price level. This measure is calculated by
      dividing the nominal income by the price level, and expressing the result
      in terms of a reference year or base year. The Consumer Price Index (CPI)
      is a measure of the average change over time in the prices paid by
      consumers for a basket of goods and services. This measure is used to
      track inflation and to adjust incomes, wages, and other economic data for
      the effects of inflation. Personal income tax is a type of tax that is
      levied on the income of individuals or households. This tax is typically
      calculated as a percentage of the taxable income, and it is used to fund
      government programs and services. To calculate personal income tax, you
      need to determine the taxable income, which is the amount of income that
      is subject to tax, after taking into account any deductions, exemptions,
      or credits that are allowed under the tax laws. The taxable income is then
      multiplied by the tax rate to calculate the tax liability.

    <h2>Week 3</h2>
    <h4><u>Materials Learned</u></h4>
    <ul>
      <li>Profit Analysis and Breakeven Point</li>
      <li>Cost Volume Analysis</li>
      <li>Constructing a Breakeven Chart</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      The breakeven point is the point at which the total revenues from a
      business activity or investment are equal to the total costs. This point
      is also known as the "break-even point" or "break-even point of sales."
      The breakeven point is calculated by dividing the total fixed costs by the
      difference between the price per unit and the variable cost per unit. This
      calculation shows the number of units that must be sold in order to break
      even, assuming that the prices and costs remain constant. Cost-volume
      analysis is a method of analyzing the relationships between costs, volume,
      and profitability in a business. This analysis is based on the assumption
      that costs have a fixed and a variable component, and that the total cost
      of a product or service is the sum of these two components. The fixed cost
      is the cost that does not change with the volume of production or sales,
      such as rent, salaries, or insurance. The variable cost is the cost that
      changes with the volume of production or sales, such as materials, labor,
      or shipping.

    <h2>Week 4</h2>
    <h4><u>Materials Learned</u></h4>
    <ul>
      <li>Simple Interest</li>
      <li>Compound Interest</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      Simple interest is a type of interest that is calculated based only on the
      principal amount of a loan or investment, and not on any accumulated
      interest. This type of interest is typically used for short-term loans or
      investments, where the interest is paid or earned at regular intervals. To
      calculate simple interest, you need to know the principal amount, the
      interest rate, and the length of time for which the interest is being
      calculated. The interest is then calculated by multiplying the principal
      by the interest rate and the length of time, and expressing the result as
      a percentage of the principal. Compound interest is a type of interest
      that is calculated based on the principal amount of a loan or investment,
      and on any accumulated interest. This type of interest is typically used
      for long-term loans or investments, where the interest is compounded over
      time, meaning that it is added to the principal and becomes part of the
      new, larger principal that is used to calculate the next period's
      interest.
