    <p id="p1">
      An operating system (OS) is the main software that manages all the other
      programs and processes on a computer. It provides a platform for running
      applications and managing system resources, such as memory, storage, and
      processing power. In short, an operating system is the central nervous
      system of a computer, controlling and coordinating the various parts of
      the system to ensure that everything runs smoothly.A command is the basic
      instruction that tells the operating system to do something, such as run a
      program or copy a file. Options are additional settings that can be used
      to modify the behavior of the command. For example, the -l option can be
      used with the ls command to show more detailed information about the files
      and directories in a directory. Arguments are the input that the command
      operates on, such as the name of a file or directory. n Unix and Unix-like
      operating systems, a path is a string of characters that specifies the
      location of a file or directory in the file system. A path can be either
      absolute or relative.

    <ul>
      <li>Navigating the File System</li>
      <li>Listing Directory Contents</li>
      <li>Unix/ Linux File Types</li>
    </ul>
    <p id="p2">
      To navigate the file system in Unix, you can use the cd command to change
      your current working directory. For example, to navigate to the
      /home/user/documents directory, you would use the following command: cd
      /home/user/documents. To list the contents of a directory in Unix, use the
      ls command. For example, to list the contents of the current directory,
      you can use the following command: ls. In Unix-like operating systems,
      files are grouped into different types based on their function and
      content. Some common file types in Unix include: Regular files: These are
      regular files that contain data or other information. They can be text
      files, image files, executables, or any other type of file. Directories:
      These are special files that contain a list of other files and
      directories. Directories are used to organize files in a hierarchical
      structure. Symbolic links: These are special files that point to another
      file or directory. Symbolic links are often used to create aliases or
      shortcuts to other files or directories.

    <ul>
      <li>File and directory permission</li>
      <li>Using the VI Editor.</li>
      <li>Editing a File With the VI Editor</li>
    </ul>
    <p id="p3">
      n Unix-like operating systems, file permissions determine who can access
      and modify a file. File permissions are specified by a set of characters
      that are associated with each file and directory. These characters
      indicate which operations are allowed for each user or group of users.
      There are three classes of users that can be associated with file
      permissions: the owner of the file, the members of the file's group, and
      all other users. For each of these classes, there are three permissions
      that can be specified: read, write, and execute. o access the vi editor in
      Unix, you can open a terminal and run the vi command followed by the name
      of the file you want to edit. For example, to open a file called file.txt
      in the vi editor, you can run the following command: vi file.txt

      <li>Introduction to Shell Scrips</li>
      <li>Shell Logic Structure</li>
    </ul>
    <p id="p4">
      A shell script is a text file that contains a sequence of commands for a
      Unix-like operating system. Shell scripts are typically used to automate
      tasks that are performed frequently or repetitively, such as backups,
      installations, or data processing. A shell script is a text file that
      contains a sequence of commands for a Unix-like operating system. The
      structure of a shell script typically consists of the following elements:
      Shebang line, Comments, Variables, and Control Structures
