    <h2>Week 1</h2>
    <h4><u>Materials Learned</u></h4>
    <ul>
      <li>Variables</li>

    <p id="p1">
      In week 1 of Algorithms and Problem Solving I learned about variables,
      declarations, variable types and data types. When making a program the
      data in the computer's memory needs to be stored so it can execute
      operations on that data. These are stored in the program by using
      variables. Most programming languages require variables to be declared
      before they are used in a program. A variable declaration specifies the
      variables name and the variables data type. The data type is the type of
      data the variable will hold. In most programming languages, an error
      occurs if you try to store values of other types in the variable.

    <h2>Week 2</h2>
    <h4><u>Materials Learned</u></h4>
    <ul>
      <li>Variable initialization</li>
      <li>Uninitialized variable</li>
      <li>Assignments and Calculations</li>
    </ul>
    <p id="p2">
      In week 2 of Algorithms and Problem Solving I was taught about variable
      initialization, Uninitialized variables, and assignments and calculations.
      In the previous week I learned about variables. Variables can optionally
      be assigned a value to it in a declaration statement. This is known as
      <i>initialization</i>. Uninitialized variables are variables that have
      been declared but not been assigned a value or initialized.When we write
      an assignment statement in pseudocode, we will write the word Set,
      followed by the name of the variable, followed by an equal sign (=),
      followed by the value we want to store in the variable.

    <h2>Week 3</h2>
    <h4><u>Materials Learned</u></h4>
    <ul>
      <li>Program Development</li>
      <li>Algorithms</li>
      <li>Pseudocode</li>
    </ul>
    <p id="p3">
      In week 3 of Algorithms and Problem Solving I learned about program
      development, algorithms, and pseudocode. A program must be systematically
      and properly designed before coding begins. This design process results in
      the construction of an algorithm. We format it by defining the problem,
      outlining the solution, developing the outline into an algorithm, coding
      the algorithm into a specific programming language, testing the algorithm
      for correctness. The next topic we learned in week 3 is algorithms. An
      algorithm is like a recipe: it lists the steps involved in accomplishing a
      task. It can be defined in programming terms as a set of detailed,
      unambiguous and ordered instructions developed to describe the processes
      necessary to produce the desired output from a given input. The algorithm
      is written in simple English and is not a formal document. An algorithm
      must be lucid and precise and unambiguous, Give the correct solution, And
      eventually end.

    <h2>Week 4</h2>
    <h4><u>Materials Learned</u></h4>
    <ul>
      <li>Modules</li>
      <li>Hierarchy Chart</li>
    </ul>
    <p id="p4">
      In week 4 I learned about modules and hierarchy charts. A module is
      defined as a group of statements that perform a specific operation.
      Mostly, the programs perform tasks that are large enough to be broken down
      into several subtasks. Instead of writing a large program as one long
      sequence of statements, it is broken down into several small modules.
      These small modules can be executed in the desired order to perform the
      overall task. Hierarchy charts give a visual representation of the
      relationships between modules. A hierarchy chart, which is also known as a
      structure chart, shows boxes that represent each module in a program. The
      boxes are connected in a way that illustrates their relationship to one
      another. At the top of the hierarchy chart is the controlling module, or
      mainline. On the next level are the modules that are called directly from
      the mainline - that is, the modules immediately subordinate to the
      mainline. On the next level are the modules that are subordinate to the
      modules on the first level, and so on. The chart shows no particular
      sequence for processing the modules.
