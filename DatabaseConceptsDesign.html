      Oracle SQL is a programming language used for managing and manipulating
      data in Oracle databases. It provides a variety of commands and statements
      for creating, querying, and modifying the database and its data. The
      design of a database using Oracle SQL involves several key steps,
      including identifying the data to be stored, defining the structure of the
      data, and implementing the database using SQL commands. Proper design of a
      database is crucial for ensuring that the data can be efficiently accessed
      and managed, and that it is organized in a way that supports the needs and
      requirements of the application or system that will use the database.

    <ul>
      <li>Conceptual and Physical Model</li>
      <li>Entites Instances and Attriubutes</li>
      <li>Entity Relationship Model (ERD)</li>
      <li>ERDish and Drawing Relationships</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      The difference between conceptual and physical models in Oracle database
      design is that a conceptual model is a high-level representation of the
      data and its relationships, while a physical model is a detailed,
      implementation-specific representation of the database. In database
      design, the difference between an entity instance and an attribute is that
      an entity instance is a specific occurrence or instance of an entity,
      while an attribute is a characteristic or property of an entity. Speaking
      ERDish in database design refers to using the terminology and notation of
      entity-relationship diagrams (ERDs) to communicate and describe the design
      of a database.

    <ul>
      <li>Identifying Relationship.</li>
      <li>Relationship Types</li>
      <li>Resolving Many to Many Relationship</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      There are several types of relationships that can exist in a database,
      including one-to-one, one-to-many, many-to-one, and many-to-many
      relationships. A one-to-one relationship is a relationship between two
      entities where each entity is associated with only one instance of the
      other entity. For example, a person entity could have a one-to-one
      relationship with a passport entity, where each person is associated with
      only one passport and each passport is associated with only one person. A
      one-to-many relationship is a relationship between two entities where each
      instance of the first entity is associated with one or more instances of
      the second entity, but each instance of the second entity is associated
      with only one instance of the first entity. For example, a customer entity
      could have a one-to-many relationship with an order entity, where each
      customer is associated with one or more orders, but each order is
      associated with only one customer. A many-to-one relationship is similar
      to a one-to-many relationship, but it is the reverse direction. In a
      many-to-one relationship, each instance of the first entity is associated
      with only one instance of the second entity, but each instance of the
      second entity is associated with one.

    <ul>
      <li>Supertypes and Subtypes</li>
      <li>Documenting Business Rules</li>
      <li>UIDs</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      In database design, supertypes and subtypes are used to represent
      hierarchical relationships between entities. A supertype is a high-level
      entity that represents a general category or group of entities, while a
      subtype is a more specific entity that belongs to a particular category or
      group represented by the supertype. Business rules are used in database
      design to define the constraints, conditions, and requirements that must
      be satisfied by the data in a database. Documenting business rules in
      database design involves capturing and recording these constraints,
      conditions, and requirements in a clear and concise manner, so that they
      can be used to guide the design and implementation of the database. A UID,
      or a unique identifier, is a field in a database that is used to uniquely
      identify each record or entity in the database. A UID is typically a
      primary key field, which means that it is a field that has a unique value
      for each record in the database and is used to identify and distinguish
      each record from the others.
